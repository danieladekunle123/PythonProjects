This program is a GUI-based unit converter, titled "The Ultimate Unit Converter," 
I developed this using Python with the customtkinter and standard tkinter libraries. 
It is designed to convert between different units of length and mass. 

In summary, the program creates a user-friendly interface for converting units of length and mass. Users select the type of unit (length or mass), the unit they are converting from and to, enter the value, and then click 'Convert' to get the result. The interface is styled using customtkinter, providing a modern look compared to standard tkinter widgets.
